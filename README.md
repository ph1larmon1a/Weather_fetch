# Weather fetch

The Weather Fetcher Shell Script is a bash script designed to fetch and display weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The script pulls real-time weather information, formats the data, and saves it to a text file for easy reference. It also allows you to automate weather report generation by scheduling it with cron.

## First step
Make the script executable by the following command:

chmod +x weather.sh

## Second step

Modify crontab by adding the line that locates in crontab.txt
